## URL Scraper and Summarizer

## Problem Statement 

G2 regularly updates its website with new products by creating new categories and
refining existing ones. One crucial aspect of this process is ensuring that each product has
a precise description and URL before it is added to the site. We are interested in
automating the process of updating product descriptions in our database. We will provide
you with a few product URLs, and your output will be a brief 3-4 lines description of each
product.

## Description

The URL Scraper and Summarizer is a tool that allows users to scrape text data from web pages based on the URLs provided and generate concise summaries of the products mentioned on those web pages. The scraped data is processed, cleaned, and sent as input to a Large Language Model (LLM), which generates summaries for each product mentioned in the entered URLs.

## Features

- Scrapes text data from web pages based on user-provided URLs.
- Cleans and processes the scraped data by removing whitespace and other noise.
- Utilizes a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate concise summaries for each product mentioned in the entered URLs.
- Supports various natural language processing tasks, including text summarization and information retrieval.
